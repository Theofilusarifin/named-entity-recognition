# GLiNER - Generalized Named Entity Recognition

GLiNER is a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model designed for flexibility and efficiency. Built with a bidirectional transformer encoder architecture (similar to BERT), GLiNER enables the identification of any entity type, providing a powerful alternative to traditional NER models limited to predefined entity sets. It offers a middle ground between traditional NER models and Large Language Models (LLMs) by being both flexible and resource-efficient.

## Key Features

- **Flexible Entity Recognition**: Unlike conventional NER models that restrict detection to a limited set of entity types, GLiNER is capable of identifying custom, user-defined entities.
- **BERT-like Architecture**: Leverages a bidirectional transformer encoder, enabling contextual understanding of entities within sentences for improved accuracy.
- **Resource Efficiency**: GLiNER is smaller and less resource-intensive compared to LLMs, making it suitable for scenarios with limited computational resources.

## Why GLiNER?

Most Named Entity Recognition models are constrained by a fixed set of entities (e.g., "Person," "Location," "Organization"). On the other hand, while LLMs offer flexibility in entity detection, they are often large, computationally expensive, and may not be practical for all scenarios. GLiNER addresses these challenges by combining the flexibility of LLMs with the efficiency of traditional NER models, making it an ideal choice for applications requiring adaptable NER on a budget.
